# Raisin | Threads made easy
Raisin is a priority based coroutine manager with a few additional twists. Its name in its prototyping stage was originally 'ryzen', the joke being that it was a 'threadripper'. Obviously that name is a poor choice, so something similar was decided upon.

As is evident Raisin is designed for lua's coroutines to allow for many freedoms, such as manual prioritization, grouping, toggling, and a manual coroutine death termination amount. 

# Installation

Currently the only installation method is directly downloading the file/repo:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugeblank/raisin/master/raisin.lua```

Depending on how well recieved this is (as if XP) I may make it a luarocks package.

# Examples
Examples are offered at [this](https://github.com/hugeblank/raisin-demos) repository. If you have further demonstrations, or a better example of what is already provided please make a pull request, contribution is welcome!
