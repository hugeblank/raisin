# Raisin | Threads made easy
Raisin is a priority based coroutine manager with a few additional twists. Its name in its prototyping stage was originally 'ryzen', the joke being that it was a 'threadripper'. Since ryzen had bad SEO, something similar was decided upon. 

Raisin is designed for lua's coroutines to allow for many freedoms, such as manual prioritization, grouping, toggling, and a manual coroutine death termination amount.
